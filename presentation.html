# Memory management strategies
### Garbage Collector vs Rust Ownership Model

---

## Agenda

* Memory
* Garbage Collection
* Rust Ownership Model
* Other benefits

---

## Memory

* Stack
    * Quick allocation/deallocation
    * Restricted in size
    * Lifetime restricted to "stack frame"

---

## Memory

* Stack
    * Quick allocation/deallocation
    * Restricted in size
    * Lifetime restricted to "stack frame"


* Heap
    * Slow allocation/deallocation
    * More memory available
    * Memory leaks

Situation when allocated memory cannot be returned to system while application is running

## Garbage Collection

* Reference Counting
    * Lisp, Python, C++
    * Simple to implement
    * Cycles may lead to leaks
        * Avoiding cycles
        * Generational Garbage Collector (Python)
        * Weak pointers (C++)

* Mark and Sweep
    * Java, C#, D
    * Resistant to any memory leaks
    * Faster than Reference Counting

## Garbage Collection

.quote.no-decor[
> Garbage collected programs are often faster. This is counterintuitive, but the reasons are: 
> * Reference counting is a common solution to solve explicit memory allocation problems.
> * Garbage collection kicks in only when memory gets tight. When memory is not tight, the program runs at full speed and does not spend any time tracing and freeing memory.

## So why we even bother?

### Zero overhead rule

* Microcontrollers
* MIPS (GPUs)
* Resources limited environments
* Fast calculations (eg. Gamedev industry)

# Memory management by static analysis

---

## Scoped stack allocations

```rust
fn foo() {
    let _x = [4; 100];
    // _x memory is released (everything on stack)
}
```

---

## RAII

```rust
fn foo() {
    let _x = vec![4; 100];
    // _x memory is released (both stack and heap)
}

fn bar() {
    let _x = Box::new(5);
    // _x memory is released (both stack and heap)
}
```

---

## Moving by default

```rust
fn foo(_arg: Vec<u32>) {
    // _arg memory is released
}

fn bar() {
    vec![4; 100] // created Vec is moved while retuned to calee
    // nothing is released
}

fn main() {
    let x = vec![4; 100];
    foo(x); // x is moved into "foo",
            // so "foo" responsible for releasing xs memory
    let _y = bar();
    // _y memory is released
}
```
---

## Borrows

```rust
fn foo(_arg: &Vec<u32>) {
    // _arg only borrowed, will be released by calee, not here
}

fn foo(_arg: &mut Vec<u32>) {
    // _arg only borrowed, will be released by calee, not here
}
```

---

## Problem: releasing borrowed data

```cpp
struct A {
    std::vector<int> & x;
};

A foo() {
    std::vector<int> x(4, 100);
    return A { x };
}

int main() {
    auto x = foo(); // We have handler to some vector
                    // which doesn't exist!
}
```

---

## Solution: lifetimes

```rust
struct A<'a> {
    x: &'a Vec<u32>,
}

fn foo() -> A { // Compiler error - lifetime is missing
    let x = vec![4; 100];
    A { &x }
}

fn main() {
    let x = foo();
}
```

---

## Lifetimes

```rust
struct A<'a> {
    x: &'a [u32],
}

fn foo<'a>(a: &'a [u32]) -> A<'a> {
    let x = &a[3..5];
    A { x }
}

fn main() {
    let x = foo(&vec![4; 100]);
}
```

---

## Lifetimes

```rust
struct A<'a> {
    x: &'a [u32],
}

fn foo<'a>(a: &'a [u32]) -> A<'a> {
    let x = &a[3..5];
    A { x }
}

fn main() {
    let x = foo(&vec![4; 100]);
    println!("{}", x[4]);
}
```

---

## Lifetimes

```rust
struct A<'a> {
    x: &'a [u32],
}

fn foo<'a>(a: &'a [u32]) -> A<'a> {
    let x = &a[3..5];
    A { x }
}

fn main() {
    let x = foo(&vec![4; 100]);
    println!("{}", x[4]); // x doesn't live long enough
}
```

---

## Lifetimes

```rust
struct A<'a> {
    x: &'a [u32],
}

fn foo<'a>(a: &'a [u32]) -> A<'a> {
    let x = &a[3..5];
    A { x }
}

fn main() {
    let a = vec![4; 100];
    let x = foo(&a);
    println!("{}", x[4]);
}
```

## Runtime Memory management
### Other memory management strategies still available when benefitial

* Reference counters via `Rc`, `Arc`, `Weak`
* Garbage collector via `crossbeam-epoch`, `gc`

# Ok, but in most cases GC is good enough - any other benefits?

---

## Iterator invalidation

```Java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
    // Some elements added

    Iterator<String> it = list.iterator();
    String s = it.next();
    System.out.println(s);
    s = it.next();
    System.out.println(s);

    Collections.sort(list);
    Iterator<String> it2 = list.iterator();

    s = it.next();
    System.out.println(s);

    while (it2.hasNext()) {
        System.out.println(it2.next());
    }
}
```

---

## Iterator invalidation
### Compilation error in Rust

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut list = vec!["A", "B", "C"];
    let it = list.iter();

    list.sort(); // Error in rust - list mutated while borrowed
    it.next();
}
```

---

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut list = vec!["A", "B", "C"];
    let it = list.iter();

    list.sort(); // Error in rust - list mutated while borrowed
    it.next();
}
```

### Borrowing rules
* Any object may be borrowed read-only any number of times, unless its not currently borrowed mutably
* Any object may be borrowed mutably exactly once, unless its not currently borrowed read-only

## Data races - impossible in Rust

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 15;
    thread::spawn(|| println!(x));
    thread::spawn(|| x += 5);
}
```

---

## Memory leaks

```rust
struct A {
    b: Cell<Option<std::rc::Rc<B>>>,
}

struct B {
    a: std::rc::Rc<A>,
}

fn main() {
    let x = vec![4; 100];
    mem::forget(x); // Memory explicitly leaked

    let y = Box::new([4; 100]);
    Box::leak(y); // Memory explicitly leaked

    let a = Rc::new(A { b: Cell::new(None) });
    let b = Rc::new(B { a });
    b.a.b.set(Some(b.clone()));
    // Memory leak by `Rc` cycle
}
```

---

## Afterwords

### Pros
* All in compile time - zero runtime overhead
* Other stategies possible to implement on top of it
* Allows protection from memory corruption and data races

## Afterwords

### Pros
* All in compile time - zero runtime overhead
* Other stategies possible to implement on top of it
* Allows protection from memory corruption and data races


### Cons
* Steep learning curve
* Doesn't protect from memory leaks
* Doesn't work well with highly mutation based patterns
